# nodejs-updated
A Node.js web application deployed to Microsoft Azure using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code and GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

Overview
This project demonstrates deploying a **Node.js web application** to **Microsoft Azure** using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code and **GitLab CI/CD** pipelines. Originally, **Azure DevOps** was intended to be used for the CI/CD pipelines. However, due to azure temporarily put a pausing request for free concurrency grants throught the end of the year. **GitLab** was utilized as an alternative to implement a fully automated CI/CD process.

This project is a Node.js web application deployed to Microsoft Azure using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and CI/CD pipelines. It demonstrates the integration of modern DevOps practices with cloud infrastructure to deliver scalable and automated deployments

## Features
- **Node.js Web Application**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Uses Terraform to provision Azure resources.
- **CI/CD with GitLab**: Automates validation, deployment, and updates.
- **Azure Hosting**: Deployed to Azure App Service for scalability and high availability.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1. **Node.js and npm**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (16.x or later).
2. **Terraform CLI**: Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
3. **Azure Subscription**
4. **GitLab Account**: To set up the CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Git Installed**:

```
## Infrastructure as Code:
Terraform was used to create and manage Azure resources:

Resource Group
Azure App Service Plan
Azure App Service for the Node.js application

CI/CD Pipeline:
A GitLab pipeline was created to automate testing, building, and deployment of the application.
The pipeline includes stages for validation, planning, applying Terraform scripts, and deploying the application to Azure.
